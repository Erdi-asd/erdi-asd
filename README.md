Hi there 👋
I'm Erdi from Italy, a full-stack developer currently working at Teddy. While I enjoy the developer world, my real passion lies in cloud computing and DevOps. The first time I was introduced to the cloud, I was fascinated, and since then, I've been deeply involved in learning everything about it.

Currently, I'm focusing on:

- **Automation**
- **Containers**
- **CI/CD pipelines**
- **Kubernetes**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Scripting languages**
- **Linux**
- **AWS**

My goal is to earn an AWS certification and further solidify my expertise in this field.
