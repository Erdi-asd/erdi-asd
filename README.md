Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Erdi from Italy, a full-stack developer currently working at Teddy. While I enjoy the developer world, my real passion lies in cloud computing and DevOps. The first time I was introduced to the cloud, I was fascinated, and since then, I've been deeply involved in learning everything about it.

Currently, I'm focusing on:

â€¢ Automation
â€¢ Containers
â€¢ CI/CD pipelines
â€¢ Kubernetes
â€¢ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
â€¢ Scripting languages
â€¢ Linux
â€¢ AWS

My goal is to earn an AWS certification and further solidify my expertise in this field.
